        Hi, I’m Felix, founder of Gutzfit. I am a qualified fitness trainer with a passion for hybrid training that combines strength, endurance, and functional movements. 
        My fitness journey began in my teens back in Nigeria, where I developed a deep respect for both traditional strength and modern training techniques. When I moved to the UK, 
        I embraced bodybuilding, training with dedication and precision to refine my skills and help others on their fitness journeys.With a focus on building strength and honouring 
        healthy eating rooted in our cultural traditions, I believe you can achieve your goals without giving up the local meals that connect us to our heritage. My philosophy is to “attack the day while it’s still dark,” 
        meaning I start each morning with purpose, prioritizing training and personal growth to set the tone for a productive day
